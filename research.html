<p>My research is centred around identifying and better understanding our young stellar neighbours, particularly at the lowest masses and youngest ages. These nearby (&lt;100 pc), young (&lt;100 Myr) stars provide unique tests of pre-main sequence stellar evolution and the late stages of  protoplanetary disc evolution, and represent some of the best targets for direct imaging of giant exoplanets.</p>

<p>Below are just two of the interesting topics my collaborators and I are currently working on. If you are interested in <a href="https://unsw.adfa.edu.au/our-research/astronomy-and-astrophysics" target="_blank">joining us</a> at UNSW Canberra to continue this work, please get in touch to find out more!</p>

<h2>'Peter Pan' discs around juvenile stars</h2>

<div class="caption"><img src="img/peterpan.jpg" class="lgrounded" width="625px" alt="The 'Peter Pan' disc around WISE J080822.18-644357.3" /><br/>Artist's impression of the 'Peter Pan' circumstellar disc around WISE J080822.18-644357.3 (Credit: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center/Jonathan Holden).</div>

<p><strong>A young star with a 'Peter Pan' disc retains its circumstellar gas and dust for tens of millions of years, much longer than the typical disc lifetime of a few million years. In other words, a star that refused to 'grow up'!</strong></p>

<p>Starting with the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...830L..28S/abstract" target="_blank">discovery</a> and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.476.3290M/abstract" target="_blank">our confirmation and  characterisation</a> of the disc around the 45 million year-old M-dwarf WISE J080822.18-644357.3, there are now at least half a dozen juvenile low-mass stars known to host substantial amounts of circumstellar dust and gas. Among them is our recent discovery of the oldest (55  million year-old) star to show ongoing accretion from its disc, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494...62L/abstract" target="_blank">2MASS J15460752-6258042</a>. The M5 star exhibits strong and variable optical emission (e.g. H&alpha;, He I, [OI]) as well as an infrared excess in the 11 and 24 &mu;m <em>WISE</em> bands.</p>

<p>The simplest model to explain the existence of Peter Pan discs is that primordial (i.e. first generation) discs around M-dwarfs take longer to dissipate than their higher-mass cousins, a trend also observed in younger star-forming regions. This would mean that the time available for planet formation around M-dwarfs is longer than previously thought, permitting the formation of gas giant planets at relatively late ages, in contradiction to most current planet formation theories. </p>

<p>To better understand the gas and dust properties of the prototypical Peter Pan disc around WISE J080822.18-644357.3,  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...872...92F/abstract" target="_blank">we obtained ALMA observations</a> of the system which did <em>not</em> show the presence of cold gas, seemingly ruling out a gas-rich protoplanetary disc. From the continuum emission we inferred the presence of about 0.06 Earth masses of optically-thin dust (see below), consistent with being generated through a collisional cascade of large planetesimals. This scenario still requires a long-lived gas component to explain the observed accretion signatures, which raises the question of why gas has persisted around these particular stars and not others?</p><br/>

<div class="caption" style="width: 422px;margin:0 auto"><a href="img/wisej0808.jpg"><img src="img/wisej0808.jpg" height="300px" /></a><br/>The spectral energy distribution of the Peter Pan disc around WISE J0808 from <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...872...92F/abstract" target="_blank">Flaherty et al. (2019)</a>. The blue and red blackbody components with temperatures of 1071 K and 237 K are necessary to explain the near- and mid-infrared excess (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.476.3290M/abstract" target="_blank">Murphy et al. 2018</a>), while a colder 20 K component is needed to reproduce the long-wavelength ALMA emission. </div><br/>

<p>Obtaining robust ages is crucial in the characterisation of Peter Pan systems. This involves a holistic analysis of the photometric, spectroscopic and astrometric data for each star. Kinematically tying a star to a moving group or association of known age is particularly useful, as we were able to do with WISE J0808 and the Carina Association. With <em>Gaia</em>'s high precision astrometry now available for millions of stars, determining the prevalence and evolutionary status of Peter Pan discs will soon be possible.</p>

<br/><h2>The young groups &eta; (eta) and &epsilon; (epsilon) Chamaeleontis</h2>

<div class="caption"><img src="img/chamaeleon.jpg" width="625px" alt="Chamaeleon region" class="lgrounded"/><br/><em>Infrared Astronomical Satellite</em> (IRAS) 25/60/100 micron colour composite of the Chamaeleon region, showing the young open cluster &eta; Cha, the &epsilon; Cha Association and the background Chamaeleon dark clouds.</div>

<p><strong>Two of the most intriguing and understudied young moving groups in the southern sky are the open cluster &eta; Cha and the &epsilon; Cha Association. Both are &lt;10 million years old and only 100 pc away, making them some of the youngest stars in the Solar neighbourhood.</strong></p>

<p>For several years we have been conducting a <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.435.1325M/abstract" target="_blank">systematic investigation</a> of these groups and the young stars in their vicinity. This has already lead to several notable discoveries:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em><a href="http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.406L..50M" target="_blank">The low mass stellar halo around &eta; Cha</a></em></strong><br/>
The central core of &eta; Cha appears to be missing many low mass stars, we believe due to dynamical evolution, which dispersed them to large radii. From a wide field photometric and proper motion survey around &eta; Cha, combined with follow-up spectroscopy, <a href="http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.406L..50M" target="_blank">we discovered several young, low-mass stars</a> up to 5 degrees from the cluster. These stars have proper motions and radial velocities consistent with ejection from &eta; Cha over the past 5-10 Myr.</li>

<li><strong><em><a href="http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.411L..51M" target="_blank">Episodic accretion in 'old' pre-main sequence clusters</a></em></strong><br/>
Several members of &eta; and &epsilon; Cha exhibited strong and variable H-alpha emission in our ANU 2.3-m/<a href="https://rsaa.anu.edu.au/observatories/instruments/wide-field-spectrograph-wifes" target="_blank">WiFeS</a> spectra, including one star which showed <a href="http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.411L..51M" target="_blank">signs of accretion from a circumstellar disc</a>. Infrared photometry from the <em>WISE</em> satellite confirms the presence of a disc around the star and demonstrates that  accretion can continue at low levels long after the majority of circumstellar material has dissipated, much like in 'Peter Pan' systems.</li>

<li><strong><em><a href="http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.424..625M" target="_blank">A wide pre-main sequence binary born in Sco-Cen</a></em></strong><br/>
Two of the &eta; Cha halo candidates appear noticeably older than the cluster and are only 42 arcseconds apart. <a href="http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.424..625M" target="_blank">We have shown</a> that they are almost certainly an isolated, 10 million year-old binary system. Astrometry from the <em>Gaia</em> mission confirms the stars are moving through space together at a distance of 112 pc. The dynamical fragility of this wide system puts strong constraints on its birthplace, which we believe was in the outskirts of the Sco-Cen OB association.</li>

<h3>Young eclipsing binary</h3>

<div class="imgcredit"><img src="img/press_binary.jpg" width="220px" alt="2MASS J2126-8140" class="rounded"/><br/>Credit: J. Pinfield/Uni. of Hertfordshire.</div>

<p>My co-authors and I  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491.4902M/abstract" target="_blank">recently published</a> the first detailed examination of the 24 million year-old M-dwarf eclipsing binary <a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=THOR+42&submit=SIMBAD+search" target="_blank">THOR 42</a>. </p>

<p>To better measure the masses, radii, temperatures and ages of the two stars, we obtained observations from the <a href="https://rsaa.anu.edu.au/observatories/telescopes/anu-23m-telescope" target="_blank">ANU 2.3-m telescope</a>, the <a href="https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/Magellan" target="_blank">Magellan 6.5-m</a> in Chile and the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/tess-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite" target="_blank"><em>TESS</em></a> satellite, among other facilities. THOR 42 is now one of the most precisely characterised pre-main sequence eclipsing binaries known, and a vital touchstone object against which to test theoretical models of stellar evolution. </a></p>

<br/><h3>The disappearing disc</h3>

<div class="imgcredit"><img src="img/press_disk2.jpg" width="220px" alt="Disc" class="rounded"/><br/>Credit: Gemini Observatory/AURA, Lynette Cook</div>

<p>In 2012 <a href="http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012Natur.487...74M" target="_blank">we reported in <em>Nature</em></a> the curious case of a young, Sun-like star (<a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=TYC+8241+2652+1&amp;submit=SIMBAD+search" target="_blank">TYC 8241-2652-1</a>) whose infrared flux decreased by a factor of 30 <em>in less than two years.</em> This is orders of magnitude faster than models of circumstellar disc dissipation predict.</p>

<p>The approximately 10 million year-old star seems to have gone from hosting substantial quantities of warm, dusty material to retaining only a meagre amount of cooler dust. Such a rapid transformation has not been observed in any other star, and so far no physical model can satisfactorily explain all the observations.</p>

<br/><h3>Meeting the neighbours</h3>

<div class="imgcredit"><img src="img/press_apcol.jpg" width="220px" alt="AP Col" class="rounded"/><br/>Credit: Adric Riedel, GSU/RECONS/SMARTS</div>

<p>Adric Riedel (STScI), Carl Melis (UCSD) and I  <a href="http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....142..104R" target="_blank"> discovered</a> that the M4.5 flare star <a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=ap+col&amp;submit=SIMBAD+search" target="_blank">AP Columbae</a> is in fact the closest (8.4 pc) young star to the Sun, with an estimated age of only 40-50 million years. It is a member of a young group of stars called the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01508" target="_blank">Argus Association</a>.</p>

<p>This combination of youth and proximity makes AP Col an ideal target for direct detection of extra-solar planets. However,  <a href="http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...754..127Q" target="_blank">high-contrast imaging</a> on the Very Large Telescope in Chile and the Keck telescopes in Hawaii has so far ruled out any Jupiter-mass companions at separations of greater than 3&ndash;4 AU.
